About me
--------

Iâ€™m Pasi Lallinaho, a geek and open source contributor from Helsinki, Finland.

I've done the bulk of my open source work with [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org), [Shimmer Project](https://shimmerproject.org) and [Xfce](https://xfce.org).

More bits about me, my history with open source as well as my contact details can be found on the [Author]({{ "/author" | relative_url }}) page.

Digitoucan

My company [Digitoucan](https://digitoucan.fi) offers services in websites, graphic design and more.

This site
---------

This site used to be powered by WordPress. After years of inactivity, I decided to convert the site to Jekyll for easier archive-state maintenance.
