I’m **Pasi Lallinaho**, also known as _knome_ in IRC and various other places. I’m a husband, a father of two kids and an entrepreneur from Helsinki, Finland.

My company [Digitoucan](https://digitoucan.fi/) provides services on graphic design, web and content consultancy. I’m a self-taught professional, and I’ve worked within the business since the early 2000's.

My formal profession is bachelor of social services.

My work with open source
------------------------

**In 2006** I both converted to Linux-only desktops and started contributing to open source. My first contributions were user support and marketing work with the _Rokymotion_ marketing team in the [Amarok](https://amarok.kde.org) project, where I contributed for about two years.

**In 2008** I started contributing to [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/). I was nominated as the Marketing Lead in September 2008 and I held the position until April 2010.

In December, I attended [Ubuntu Developer Summit](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDSJaunty) for the 9.04 release on the Google Campus in Mountain View.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">During the years, I’ve worked with the Xubuntu team in various of ways. You can see a brief list of major tasks I’ve worked on for Xubuntu in the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PasiLallinaho">Ubuntu wiki</a>.</blockquote>

**In 2009** I was granted the official _Ubuntu member_ status.

**In 2010** I founded the [Shimmer Project](https://shimmerproject.org/) with _Steve Dodier_. The Shimmer Project still contributes themes for Xubuntu, but has since gathered a much wider audience.

In January, I was invited to London as the community representative to get a sneak peek of the new Ubuntu brand.

**In 2011** I was elected as the new Xubuntu Project Lead. The overview of my plans for the (then) near future with some kind words of support can be found at my [2011 nomination wikipage](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PasiLallinaho/XPL2011).

**In 2012** I started releasing some [WordPress plugins](https://github.com/knomepasi/WordPress/) I’ve been building during the years for open source projects as well as some of my clients.

In October, I attended the Ubuntu Developer Summit for the 13.04 release in Copenhagen.

**In 2013** my Xubuntu Project Lead term was extended. For completeness and another set of plans and kind words, see my [2013 nomination wikipage](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PasiLallinaho/XPL2013).

**In 2014** my extended Xubuntu Project Lead term ended with the 14.04 LTS release. After taking a 6-month break from leadership tasks, I was nominated the Xubuntu Website Lead.

**In 2016** I was elected to the Xubuntu Council. In June, I attended the [2015 Google Code-In](https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/2015/) winners prize trip to San Francisco as the representative for the Ubuntu community mentors.

**In 2018** my term in the Xubuntu Council ended and I started working more directly with Xfce and their infrastructure as well as modernizing the website and refreshing their looks.

**In 2019** [I gave up my Xubuntu Website Lead position](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/xubuntu-devel/2019-October/011850.html) as well as some other long-term tasks I’ve been working on.
