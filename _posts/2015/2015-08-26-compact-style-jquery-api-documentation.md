Everybody who develops websites – or pretty much anything – knows that you sometimes need to check something from the documentation. When you do that, you want to do that as quickly as possible, without distraction from the documentation itself.

One of the documentation I use more or less frequently is the jQuery API documentation. Unfortunately, while the website design is nice enough and works well for the non-documentation part, it is a bit distracting on the API documentation section and slows me down.

To fight this, I've written a simple [Stylish style for *api.jquery.com* that makes the layout a bit more compact](https://gist.github.com/knomepasi/a1fd746f45627f271e70) and thus gets less in the way. Again, the easiest way to get this Gist is the *Raw* button.

Enjoy!
