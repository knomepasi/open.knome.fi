The Ubuntu community team has recently set up [Find-a-Task](http://community.ubuntu.com/contribute/find-a-task/), which is a small tool that helps new contributors find a task to start working on. If you click around (long enough), you will also find [Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org/) tasks in there. How nice of us!

There's one problem though... The content is unfortunately maintained in a private environment, and there's no easy way to see all the tasks. What if you wanted to check if a very similar task, or exactly the same task, already exists?

*Stop the clicking already!* I wrote a simple [Greasemonkey script that outputs the full index of Find-a-Task](https://gist.github.com/knomepasi/08d651fa7f666c445f89) instead of showing you the different categories and tasks one by one. The easiest way to install the script is to click on the **Raw** -button on the Gist.

The team has only started gathering these tasks around the community. Some have already came in, but there's room for a lot more expansion.

If your team wants to add some tasks, join the **\#ubuntu-community-team** IRC channel on Freenode and shout your tasks out loud. The community team will update the tool with your tasks as long as you provide them the name, description, target URL and the desired category for each task.

Go add a task... **quickly**!
