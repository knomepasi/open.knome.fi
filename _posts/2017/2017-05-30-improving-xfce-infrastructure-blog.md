Along with all [Romain mentioned on his blog](https://blog.alteroot.org/articles/2017-05-30/road-to-xfce-4.14-part-2.html) today, I've finished one small bit of infrastructure update after this; the [Xfce blog](https://blog.xfce.org/) is now sporting a theme that matches the style of the rest of the Xfce websites.

Again, if you find any problems with the new theme, whether in its looks or functionality, file a bug against the [blog product on Xfce bugzilla](https://bugzilla.xfce.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=blog.xfce.org&component=General).

Happy reading until the next update â€“ which should happen soon...
