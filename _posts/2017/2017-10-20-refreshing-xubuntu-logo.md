Earlier this year I worked a bit with our logo to propose a small change to it – first change to the logo in 5 years. The team approved, but for various reasons the new logo did not make it to 17.10. Now we're ready to push it out to the world.

For the last five years, we've served two versions of the logo – one for small rendered sizes and one for larger sizes – because the whiskers needed to look good in all sizes. This has been slightly confusing for people who want to use the Xubuntu logo outside the material curated by the Xubuntu team. To be honest, the team itself has been a bit confused at times too and sometimes special arrangements have been made.

The new logo solves this problem – there is now one version for all sizes. While fixing this small annoyance (by essentially making the weight of the whiskers something in between the old versions), I improved their shape and distance to the head a little bit. Finally, I cleaned up some path nodes to make the head vector slightly less complex – without changing the looks of it too much.

I will be working to get the logo spread out everywhere as soon as possible starting from now. If **you** are using the Xubuntu logo on your website (or any place really), take action now to update it.

The new logo is already available from the [Brand Resources](https://xubuntu.org/resources/) page on the Xubuntu website.
