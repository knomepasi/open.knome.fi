In addition to porting Xfce to GTK3, the Xfce team has become more active in (at least) one other area: improving the infrastructure. Today I'm happy to tell you that we've finished another bit of the infrastructure update: [the Xfce website](https://xfce.org/)!

The most important feature of the updated website is that it is now **fully responsive**. You can now browse the website with a huge resolution or with one of the smallest smartphones and the site accommodates to your environment.

The responsive design isn't limited to just tweaking the site width either; we have also mobile-optimized the slideshow on the front page and a lot more!

On the front page you can see another new feature as well â€“ a section showing the latest articles from the [Xfce Blog](https://blog.xfce.org/) feed. We have some plans to integrate an all Xfce releases feed to the front page later, but for this we'll need some other updates for the infrastructure.

Along with these bigger improvements, we've fixed a bunch of bugs, updated many HTTP links to their HTTPS counterparts and updated the content to be as up-to-date as possible.

Should you find a bug on the website, please file it against the [website product on Xfce Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.xfce.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=www.xfce.org&component=General).

Enjoy!
