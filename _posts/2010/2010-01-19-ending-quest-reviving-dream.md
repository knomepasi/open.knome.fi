This is the official ending for my quest for a new mouse.

The Logitech LS1 is a better mouse than I dared to hope. It is definitely not too small, but actually quite perfectly sized. It's also way more precise than my old mouse. I even have had to turn the mouse acceleration to near minimum. The *sound* the new mouse gives was also important for me, and I have to say that the LS1 is even more quiet and doesn't rattle like cheap plastic as the MS mouse.

The horizontal scroll is still a bit weird feature, and the scrolling isn't as smooth as vertical. To be fair, the scrollwheel is more stiff generally, so maybe it's just the newness. Even if it didn't loose a bit, I'd still be happy with it. At least it's not that easy to accidentally scroll sideways. I had to tweak the horizontal scroll in Firefox to be able to scroll more lines per one "click". The settings I changed from about:config were:

```
mousewheel.horizscroll.withnokey.numlines = 10
mousewheel.horizscroll.withnokey.sysnumlines = false
```

Now horizontal scrolling works as I want. Obviously you could change the first value to whatever you wanted to get even more radical scrolling. 10 seems to be quite right for me, though.

Would I recommend this mouse for my friends? Yes I would, especially if they were thinking of buying a mouse for their laptop, and didn't want a *mini-sized* mouse. In that case I'd actually even point them to LS1, even if they asked generally about mice. I personally like corded mouse, but if you are a cordless mouse fan, this might not be for you.

Just for comparison with some other modern mouse from Logitech: As I bought the LS1 for myself, I also bought an MX205 for my mother as a present. What I've learned from the few times I've used it, it's even smaller than LS1, probably below my threshold â€“ I wouldn't be able use that mouse for hours.

Farewell, Microsoft mouse. I've finally got rid of all of my MS hardware. Next on the drop list is Windows XP, which I only run under VMWare because of Adobe Photoshop CS2 and testing websites with various versions of IE. Lately, Inkscape has started to replace PS, but I still need it for a few things and I don't expect this thing to change in the near future. You never should let go of your dreams.
