Due to quite a lot of work with my thesis, school assignments as well as some money-making job, I haven't been able to update my blog as actively as I would've wanted. Of course, having been busy means that I wouldn't have had anything to write about either. Anyway, here's some links in a more or less brainstormy, taley form.

[Presentation Zen](http://www.presentationzen.com/) is a site I accidentally bumped into when reading the blog of [Jason Walker](http://www.jasonwalker.com/) (who, by the way, wasn't the [musician Jason Walker](http://www.myspace.com/jasonwalkeronline) who I was searching for). They had a nice article on [how to make presentations in the TED style](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2009/05/making-presentations-in-the-ted-style.html).

So, everybody knows [TED](http://www.ted.com/)?

Okay, so the *PZ* article linked to a TED talk by Hans Rosling about the [myths of the so-called developing world](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html) with some very nice statistic artwork. Go to [Gapminder.org](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html) to browse them yourself.

On TED, among others I listened to talks by [Benjamin Zander](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/benjamin_zander_on_music_and_passion.html) and [Jamie Oliver](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/jamie_oliver.html). Awesomeness! Also, I watched a video by [Ze Frank on the TED blog](http://blog.ted.com/2006/08/29/ze_frank_on_ted/).

Ze Frank led me to, well [zefrank.com](http://www.zefrank.com/). And eventually to [ScribblerToo by Mario Klingemann](http://www.zefrank.com/scribbler/scribblertoo/). If you thought you can't draw, please do fiddle around with ScribblerToo. You sure can.

On a completely different journey to Internet, I wandered to [Eran Hilleli's profile on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/eranhill). That stuff is gorgeous. Probably should dive [deeper](http://vimeo.com/3872617) into [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/).

And finally, just a bunch of (alphabetically ordered) links that have been floating around too long in the "learn more" -section of my brain and bookmarks:

- [Autosuggest Textbox with JS, part 2](http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/ncz/column2/4.html) (mental note to self: also see DOM Scripting in the book shelf)
- [Diaspora](http://www.joindiaspora.com/)
- [Shawshank Redemption](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/), a movie I should see, I hear
- [Sun Presenter Console](http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/presenter-screen), which could prove useful if I ever again did a presentation
- [Watts on French Eurosport](http://video.eurosport.fr/watts/videos.shtml); these are sometimes funny

Sorry for the dump. I'll get back to you with more serious tone later.
