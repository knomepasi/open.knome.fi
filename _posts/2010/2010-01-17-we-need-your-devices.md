The thunar-volman user survey has ended, see the [results at Jannis' blog entry](http://gezeiten.org/post/2010/01/Thunar-volman-and-the-deprecation-of-HAL). Thanks for participating.

Jannis now needs a bit more help. He need to distinguish different device types based on udev properties and he has created [a wiki page](http://gezeiten.org/post/2010/01/Thunar-volman-and-the-deprecation-of-HAL) for the job. Now your job is to plug in or insert your devices (blue-ray disks, video CD's, digital cameras, Pocket PC's, Palm's, USB printers and graphic tablets) in your PC. Send the output of 'udevadm info ‐‐export-db' to [Jannis' Xfce email](mailto:jannis@xfce.org) along with the list of devices you've plugged/inserted.

Thanks again, and as usually, more information can be found in the [original blog entry](http://gezeiten.org/post/2010/01/Thunar-volman-and-the-deprecation-of-HAL).
