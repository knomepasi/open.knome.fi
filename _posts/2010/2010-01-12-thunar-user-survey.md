Hello everybody, again just a quick update and asking for help.

[Jannis Pohlmann](http://gezeiten.org/) is gathering some survey data about Thunar Volume Monitor. See the [original mail in the Thunar mailing list ](http://foo-projects.org/pipermail/thunar-dev/2010-January/004709.html)and [take the survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/R2KYSND), if you happen to use Thunar.

Have happy times using Free Software.
