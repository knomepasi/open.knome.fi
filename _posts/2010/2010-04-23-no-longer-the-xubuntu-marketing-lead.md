I think some of you have seen this coming for some time now, but now it's official.

As of [my email to the Xubuntu Developer mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/xubuntu-devel/2010-April/007488.html) some minutes ago, I'm no longer contributing to Xubuntu as the Xubuntu Marketing Lead. I will continue contributing to Ubuntu and Xubuntu as well through functional teams. This probably also means that I will keep sending some updates to the Ubuntu category of my blog, which is aggregated to Planet Ubuntu.

I hope you've had a pleasant journey this far. I have, and I look forward to our future adventures together.
