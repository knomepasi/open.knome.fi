As part of the quest for more efficient and clean computing, my primary Open Source email address is <pasi@shimmerproject.org> starting from today. Just in case something still ends up there, I will still monitor the old address, as it's now bound to my general @knome.fi -mailbox.

Thank you for your understanding. Stay tuned, more rants about Thunderbird are going to follow.
