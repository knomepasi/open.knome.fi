[The League of Moveable Type](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/) create beautiful, free and open source, @font-face ready fonts. Can do nothing but be in awe and respect these guys. Nice website as well.

[Basic Maths](http://basicmaths.subtraction.com/) seems to be a complex but beautiful and definitely working *WordPress* theme based on the Grid layout. Even if you are not going to buy it, I think it serves a few very interesting ideas. Inspire yourself!

[Stacey](http://staceyapp.com/) CMS is something I should look closer.
