Apparently, it takes some time until a laptop with Windows Vista can correctly connect to my wireless network. I wonder if it's about TKIP+AES?

Getting Thunderbird profile manager open for the first time in Windows is way too slow. Oh, how I love having /usr/bin in my PATH!

What's with the fat, ugly window borders?

When do they stop to ship useless and ugly OEM software with Windows? Also, start making sense with playing DVD's! Who wants a DVD player with (ugly) *bling* when you can have VLC?

Is it too much to ask to not have Windows preinstalled and calculated to the laptop price anyway?

And, finally, is it really so weird not being on *Facebook*?
