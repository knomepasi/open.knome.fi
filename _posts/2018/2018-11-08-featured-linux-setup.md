Late last year I answered some questions by Steven Ovadia of [Linux Rig](https://linuxrig.com/) to get my Linux setup featured on [The Linux Setup](https://linuxrig.com/the-linux-setup/).

Having a long queue scheduled, it took some time to get my interview out, but it's up now: [The Linux Setup: Pasi Lallinaho, Xubuntu](https://linuxrig.com/2018/11/07/the-linux-setup-pasi-lallinaho-xubuntu/). *The article has one outdated bit of information; since April 2018, I'm no longer a Xubuntu council member.*

If you are interested more in my hardware, read [My major hardware upgrade](https://open.knome.fi/2018/08/27/my-major-hardware-upgrade/) for some details and the reasoning why I decided to go with the NUC.
