Just a quick word from my bunker. I am quite late on this, but Xubuntu CD's are finally available to order *for free*! (Well, almost free, as you'll have to pay for the shipping.) Order yours from [On-Disk.com's Quick Ship service](http://xubuntu.org/news/quickship).

*Remember that this service is not run by the Xubuntu developers neither or Canonical. It is an independent service provided by a fellow open source community member.* Thank you [On-Disk.com](http://on-disk.com/)!

Big thanks to *Vincent* who [told this ages ago](http://xubuntublog.wordpress.com/2009/07/31/finally-free-xubuntu-cds/) and updated the [Get Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org/get) -page. As he also mentioned, the free Xubuntu CD's might be branded like the rest of Xubuntu later on.

By the way, Karmic artwork is coming together!
