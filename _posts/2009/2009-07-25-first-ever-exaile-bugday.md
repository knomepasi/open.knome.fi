Some of you might remember that the Xubuntu Team is rethinking the default applications for Karmic. *Steve*, one of our developer community members has put a remarkable amount of work to [determine](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Specifications/Karmic/DefaultMusicPlayer) the best but still quite lightweight music player for Karmic. At the moment it looks like [Exaile](http://www.exaile.org/) is going to be our choice and Steve is already working on it.

As we want to deliver the best possible media player to you with as little bugs as possible, we are very happy to tell you that the *Exaile development team* announced their very first *bugday* (see the original announcement from the [lead developers blog](http://vimtips.org/2009/07/24/exailes-very-first-bugday-event/)). If you know any Python and are willing to lend a hand, join them in fixing as many bugs as you can! More information on this event (and the future ones) can be found on the [exaile-bugday team](https://launchpad.net/~exaile-bugday) Launchpad page.

You are free to join the bugday at #exaile on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) even if you can't fix any bugs. Have fun!
