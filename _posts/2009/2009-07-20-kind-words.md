While the Xubuntu team is already planning Karmic and working hard on it, the latest Xubuntu release 9.04 (Jaunty) is getting still some attention. Read the articles by new Xubuntu users [Marc Lewis](http://www.marclewis.com/archives/2009/06/21/fedora-out-xubuntu-in/) and [Thom Holwerda](http://www.osnews.com/story/21846/Xubuntu_The_Better_Ubuntu_than_Ubuntu).

Thank you for using Xubuntu and writing these kind words. We really appreciate them and they make us even more motivated to make the next release, Xubuntu Karmic, the best (X)ubuntu release ever!
