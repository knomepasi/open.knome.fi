Hey everybody, just a quick note that Xubuntu Lucid alpha 1 is here! See[ the official cdimage.ubuntu.com -page](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/lucid/alpha-1/) to download the ISO's or the Torrents. The Torrents are not particularly healthy seeded yet, so any help with them is welcome.

Remember that the Lucid release (10.04) is a Long Term Support release, so we are trying to get the most stable release out â€“ test it as much as you like! Nasty bugs can be filed [at Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug) as usual. Also feel free to pop in at #xubuntu-devel on Freenode to discuss some bugs or annoyances. Also remember to join the official development release channel, #ubuntu+1, also on Freenode.

Have fun testing! Let's make Xubuntu Lucid better than ever!
