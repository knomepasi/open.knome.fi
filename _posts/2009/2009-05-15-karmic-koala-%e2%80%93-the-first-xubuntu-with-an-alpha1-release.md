Ubuntu has released the [alpha1 release for Karmic Koala](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/karmic/alpha1) (the release that will eventually be Ubuntu 9.10) today. What is more amazing is that this is the first release cycle we have released alpha1 for [Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org/). Party time, again!

We would love to have people testing the alpha1 release, even if it is not stable yet for everyday use. If and as you find bugs, please report them as usually [on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug).

Have fun testing!
