After many unfortunate events I am finally a Ubuntu Member. Thanks everybody for cheering me before and at the meeting. That and your kind words mean more to me than the Ubuntu Membership ever will.

Also hello everybody else reading Planet Ubuntu. Feel free to come and meet me online at #xubuntu on freenode or offline at Helsinki, Finland.

You are free to donate money to my beer fund **or** offer me free beer when met. Celebration!
