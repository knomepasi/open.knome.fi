As of today, I'm glad to announce the official birth of the Shimmer Project. The team I'll start leading consists of me, Steve Dodier (SiDi), James Schriver (dashua) and Simon Steinbei√ü (ochosi). We want to make various things look good or work better. We will not be tied with any particular project even if we work with them. You could think us of as freelancers of the Open Source world with the exception that we don't ask for any money but only work for the projects and things we have passion for.

For the first few months our main focus will be on creating a solid theme for Xfce with beautiful artwork, a bugfree GTK+ theme and all the other bits you need to have an astonishing Xfce desktop experience.
