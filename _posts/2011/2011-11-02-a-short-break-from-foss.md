I will be taking a break from FOSS starting from now. I will be off from all duties, and I will not be following IRC, the mailing lists, Launchpad or any other matters until the break ends.

I will be back any time between **Saturday, 5th of November, 22 UTC** and **Monday, 7th of November, 20 UTC**.
