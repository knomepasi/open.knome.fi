I'm back with blogging after a month.

After the visual update the blog has undergone a hosting change - twice. Everything is finally settled and everything on knome.fi should work as they used to work before the changes. If you notice anything weird on any service, or severe slowness, please be in touch.

I apologize for any inconvenience the hosting changes might have caused.
