Here comes two book recommendations from a guy from whom you don't expect book recommendations.

[HTML5 For Web Designers](http://books.alistapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers) and [CSS3 For Web Designers](http://books.alistapart.com/products/css3-for-web-designers) are fabulous books, especially the former. (HTML5 and CSS3 are both fabulous as well, but that's a totally different story.) They are both available as paperback as well as in various ebook formats. Don't miss them, if you work with the web!
