As the Xfce team announced yesterday, [Xfce 4.8 is released](http://www.xfce.org/about/news/?post=1295136000).

Congratulations and thanks to all contributors. I hope Xfce will have a bright future. The Xfce team has also created a new website theme for [Xfce.org](http://www.xfce.org/), which is also definitely an improvement. They are still having problems because of the small core developer team. It's a good time to [start contributing now](http://www.xfce.org/getinvolved).

Xfce 4.8 will also be in the next Xubuntu release, Natty Narwhal. Lionel Le Folgoc has been and is doing fabulous work to get it in. Thanks to him too. There is also [places open in the Xubuntu team](http://xubuntu.org/devel). Go fill them.
