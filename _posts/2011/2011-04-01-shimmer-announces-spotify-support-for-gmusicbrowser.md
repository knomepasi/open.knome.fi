To get more publicity to our soon-to-be-published plugin for gmusicbrowser as well as our limited-time offer, I'll repost the Shimmer Project blog entry here:

> **Spotify support for gmusicbrowser**
> 
> The Shimmer Project has decided to give a free Spotify account for a month to everybody using gmusicbrowser, alongside their new Spotify plugin for gmusicbrowser, which is to be released late tonight. Those who want the free Spotify account are asked to send email to spotify@shimmerproject.org along with their name and a screenshot or a photograph of them using gmusicbrowser.
> 
> This offer is valid for one week from now, so act quickly.

*Update: April Fools!*
