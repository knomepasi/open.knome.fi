With Xubuntu, we are currently finalizing the specifications for those roadmap items that need community approval. I discussed those briefly in my blog, in the [Roadmap closed](http://open.knome.fi/2011/11/22/roadmap-closed/) -article. All specifications should be ready by *December 29, 17UTC*, when we have our community meeting (see the [Meetings wiki page](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Meetings) for more details and the agenda). Please join us then, it's a great way to be involved and a good time to start contributing too, since we still need to *implement* all the blueprints â€“ while all of them have an assignee already, any help is always welcome.

On other news, we talk a bit about [work done in the last weeks](http://shimmerproject.org/2011/12/late-2011-updates/) in the Shimmer Project blog. Check it out!

Have a peaceful Christmas time and a very happy new year 2012!
