Finally, after waiting for several releases, Xubuntu is shipping Xfce 4.8, which allows easier menu editing - you can now use your favourite menu editor to edit the Xfce menus. In addition, you can now create panel/desktop launchers by dragging and dropping a launcher from the applications menu. How nice is that!

Xubuntu 11.04 is shipped with the [Greybird theme](http://shimmerproject.org/projects/greybird/) by [the Shimmer Project](http://shimmerproject.org/) as well as a [wallpaper created by the Shimmer team](http://open.knome.fi/2011/03/18/xubuntu-natty-default-wallpaper/).

You can download Xubuntu 11.04 from the [Xubuntu website](http://xubuntu.org/getubuntu). You can get Xubuntu on CD's and other media from [On-Disk.com](http://on-disk.com/product_info.php/products_id/1346#!tab6).
