Again some good news for Xubuntu: the Ubiquity installation slideshow for Xubuntu is now ready and merged into [the main branch](https://code.launchpad.net/~ubiquity-slideshow/ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu/html). You can start translating now!

The design is an improved version of the old slideshow; the slideshow window is now actually a bit bigger, and we added the arrows to move around to make the slideshow smoother. Works really well. Instant win! Also, the texts have been completely rewritten. There were a few keywords we didn't let off our heads when we rethought the slides and the content: fun, short, necessary. The final version became to be after hard work, many days and a few really long nights. I couldn't have done it without *Simon*, who in addition to everything else provided us the fabulous screenshots from his Natty installation.

Love it? Hate it?
