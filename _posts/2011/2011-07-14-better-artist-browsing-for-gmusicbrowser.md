Even if it's the most favorable time of the year to spend your holiday outside your own *hacking station*, Simon from the Shimmer Project has been working hard to pull together a new plugin for gmusicbrowser, the default media player for Xubuntu. The new plugin is called *similar artist queue*, and this is how Simon describes the basic functionality in the Shimmer Project blog:

> The new queue-mode I developed retrieves “similar artists” from [last.fm](http://last.fm/ "Last.fm") and creates a random queue based on the resulting group of artists. This means that you only have to select a first “seed artist”, as we decided to call it, and gmusicbrowser/last.fm will (supposedly) play similar music from your local library.
