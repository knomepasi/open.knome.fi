As we are approaching the Oneiric Ocelot release date, the Shimmer team has worked hard with the Xubuntu developers to create a new themes for Plymouth and LightDM as well as a new website.

As you might already know, Xubuntu is switching from Drupal to WordPress, at last. WordPress is a personal preference for quite many of us, and amongst others I'm very happy to be able to work with it. Without any further praises, I want to quickly show a taster of what we have accomplished this far with the new website theme:

What do you think? Is it looking as good as we think, or are we too subjective? How can we improve it?
