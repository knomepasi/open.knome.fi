We have started to brainstorm *Xubuntu Precise Pangolin*! The [Xubuntu Precise Pangolin roadmap](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Roadmap/) will contain all the information you need to contribute, including the schedule for planning and all the items in the roadmap.

The first step is to brainstorm all the new features we want in, the bugs we really want to fix and the default applications we want to review. The brainstorming period has already started, and will end on **Monday, November 21**.

Assignees for ideas should be found **during this month.** If you want to take an action item, feel free to add your name/nick in the list too already. We will send an another mail asking for assignees for not-yet-taken items on when the brainstorming period is over though, so don't worry about it just yet. Implementation for the features and other stuff will be expected to happen according to the [Ubuntu Precise Pangolin Release Schedule](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseSchedule).
