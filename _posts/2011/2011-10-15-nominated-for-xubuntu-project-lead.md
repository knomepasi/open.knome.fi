It's official now. I have been [nominated for the new Xubuntu Project Lead](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/xubuntu-devel/2011-October/007996.html) and I've confirmed that I am [willing to fill the position](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/xubuntu-devel/2011-October/007997.html) too.

The vote is on the 23rd of October at the Xubuntu Community Meeting, at **\#xubuntu-devel** at the **Freenode** IRC network. Feel free to join us and cheer for me, as well as vote. The requirement to vote is to be a member of the [Xubuntu Users Launchpad group](https://launchpad.net/%7Exubuntu-users). The group is open to join for anyone with a Launchpad account.
