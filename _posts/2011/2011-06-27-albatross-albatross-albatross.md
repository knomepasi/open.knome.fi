You read it right. Albatross!

So we've finally started working with [Albatross](http://shimmerproject.org/project/albatross/) again. There's a brief [to do -list for the new Albatross](http://wiki.knome.fi/shimmer:albatross) on the wiki, and a new, [v2.x branch in Github](https://github.com/shimmerproject/Albatross/tree/v2.x). The branch even sports a few changes towards the 2.x version!

As always, any feedback, positive or negative (as long as it is constructive) is welcome. There are big chances you will be able to affect what the new Albatross looks now that we are in midst of development.
