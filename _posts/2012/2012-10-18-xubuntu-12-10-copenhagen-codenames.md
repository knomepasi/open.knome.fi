That's it. [Xubuntu 12.10](http://xubuntu.org/news/12-10-release/ "Xubuntu 12.10") is out! [Download it now!](http://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/ "Download Xubuntu")

Only a week and a half until UDS-R and planning the next release of Xubuntu too. Copenhagen, please be prepared for some hard working by the Xubuntu team (or at least, three of us). If you are coming to UDS, don't miss the Xubuntu sessions to be announced later. You can also participate remotely, if you aren't able to make it to Denmark. Read more from the [UDS website](http://uds.ubuntu.com/). We will post more information on how to take part on the planning inside and outside UDS later.

By chance, another friend of mine is around Copenhagen too on the same week for another event. Sounds like an evening out together!

Also, see the blog article by Mark about the [codename for R: Raring Ringtail](http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1200). Though I really think that *Roaring Rabbit* would have been better. I wonder if flavors can have their own codenames...
