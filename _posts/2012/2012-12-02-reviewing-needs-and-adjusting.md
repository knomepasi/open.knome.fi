In August, I bought a new Samsung Series 5 Ultrabook (530U3C). It weighs less than 1.5 kilograms, has a 128GB SSD and 6GB of RAM. I love how silent it is, how smoothly it runs on Linux and how [good looking](http://www.samsung.com/hk_en/htmlfeature/npc/530U3C/images/con_530U3CI_08.jpg) it is! But that's it for the specifications and praise.

Rather than the specifications, this article is about redefining need, happiness and ultimately, life.

After I bought the new laptop I began noticing that I don't really want that many electronic devices around me. Especially devices that *I wasn't going to use ever again*. In fact, some of that stuff was something I've never needed but I've kept it because I *might need it*. Well, not any more – it's time to get rid of that cruft and if possible, let somebody else enjoy of it.

It's not only about stuff I already own or have owned. It's about new temptations and new gadgets around. I – and we – got to realize that all the new gadgets aren't something we need. The world we're living in doesn't need us to need them either.

At the end of the day, it's about understanding that *less is more*. Not just in computers and gadgets, but in life.
