The [WordPress-plugins repository at Github](https://github.com/knomepasi/WordPress-plugins/) is now updated and has all the plugins mentioned in the [previous article](http://open.knome.fi/2012/01/17/getting-some-wordpress-plugins-out-to-public/ "Getting some WordPress plugins out to public"). If you want to help with the development, test the plugins and send some feedback, including issues on the Github [issues tracker](https://github.com/knomepasi/WordPress-plugins/issues). The next step at an unforeseeable date in the future, is uploading the plugins to the [WordPress plugins directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/). However, this needs testing and if at all possible, code review â€“ I'm already waiting for feedback.
