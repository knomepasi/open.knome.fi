In January 2012, I finally [released three of my WordPress-plugins](http://open.knome.fi/2012/01/17/getting-some-wordpress-plugins-out-to-public/) for the general public and planned releasing [three more later](http://open.knome.fi/2012/01/25/wordpress-plugins-repository-updated/). Now in the end of April, [the repository](https://github.com/knomepasi/WordPress-plugins) consists of *eight* plugins and at least one more is on the way.

Now that the plugins are free to pick up by anyone, I'd love getting feedback on them. Where did you use them? Did you find bugs? Anything you missed in the plugins?

The bugs and wishlist items are tracked in [Issues](https://github.com/knomepasi/WordPress-plugins/issues?direction=desc&labels=&sort=created&state=open) on Github. Also, feel free to follow me on Github and/or the [tag WordPress](http://open.knome.fi/tag/wordpress/) in this blog if you think the plugins are useful.

Thanks.
