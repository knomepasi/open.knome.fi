*Update: There already was a board gaming channel on Freenode, post edited accordingly.*

There's <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">yet another</span> **a** channel for the geeks to rejoice their geekness in Freenode...

If you're interested in designer board games like Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride et cetera and/or are interested in learning about them, join us on **\#boardgames** on Freenode.

<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">For starters, we're seeing how the channel grows and gets along, so</span> please pop in to show your interest!
