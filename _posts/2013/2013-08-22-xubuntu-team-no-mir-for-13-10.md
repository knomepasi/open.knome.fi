The Xubuntu team has decided today that **Xubuntu 13.10 will not have Mir** installed by default. The decision was based on the [testing and evaluation Xubuntu team did with Mir](http://open.knome.fi/2013/08/07/dont-panic-the-state-of-xubuntu-and-mir/ "Don’t panic: the state of Xubuntu and Mir") before.

On behalf of the whole Xubuntu team, I want to thank the Mir developers for being closely in touch with the team as well as helping with any problems we had. I also want to thank everybody who tested Mir with Xubuntu – all feedback was important. **Thank you!**

The full logs and the minutes for the community meeting along with the decisive votes can be found at the Xubuntu wiki: [Xubuntu community meeting, Aug 22](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Meetings/Archive/Minutes/2013-08-22).
