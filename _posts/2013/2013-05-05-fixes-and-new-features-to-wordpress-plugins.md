Just a quick note... It's been a while since I last updated my repository for [WordPress stuff](https://github.com/knomepasi/WordPress/), but now I'm back with more plugins as well as fixes and new features to old ones!

Most prominently *Photoslider* now supports even more options. In addition I've started to standardize the plugins in an effort trying to use the best possible practices.

Again, all feedback and patches are welcome!
