In the election that ended last Thursday, the Xubuntu community elected me to continue my term as the Xubuntu Project Lead. The extended term consists two releases and ends with the LTS release in April 2014.

Now it's time to thank everybody organizing the election, cheering and voting. **Thank you!**

*As a funny detail, I heard the election results while running a Q&amp;A session about Xubuntu at [Happy Hacking Day](http://happyhackingday.org/). After the results were announced, there was a round of applauds from the crowd. I can't think of a better place to be when finding out – surrounded by the community.*

I hope we can improve Xubuntu even further during the two forthcoming cycles, but I can't do it by myself. Join our team and help us building a better operating system! To read more about contributing, head to the [Get Involved section of the Xubuntu website](http://xubuntu.org/contribute/).
